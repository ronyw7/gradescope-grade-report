# Gradescope Grade Report
### Automated grade report for students on Gradescope using an autograder backend. 

Developed at Data 101 at UC Berkeley in Fall 2023. 

`autograder/output_final_grades.py` is modified from prev course staff implementation.

The following guides are available in `.md` and `.pdf`:
- `Applying Slip Days while Maximizing Student Grades`
- `Setting up Gradescope Autograder for Grade Reports`

Course instructors and TAs, feel free to fork and develop in your own repo or contribute to this tool by submitting new issues/PRs.
